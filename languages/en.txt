ABOUT_HTMLTITLE=About - Cryptris
ABOUT_DESCRIPTION=Cryptris is a game proposed by <a href="http://www.inria.fr/" target="_blank">Inria</a> and developed by <a href="http://digitalcuisine.fr/" target="_blank">Digital&nbsp;Cuisine</a>, with the support of <a href="http://www.capmaths.fr">Cap'Maths</a>, and proposed under an open <a href="license.html">license</a>.
ABOUT_GOAL=The goal of this game is to show the interest of so-called asymmetric cryptography. In a series of puzzles, the player decrypts a message using a private key, while the computer tries to decrypt the same message using a&nbsp;public&nbsp;key.
ABOUT_DIFFICULTY=The difficulty for the player increases linearly, while the computer will have more and more trouble. Cryptography protects your data effectively!

ARCADE_DIALOG_GAME_OVER_TITLE=Game over (the computer won)
ARCADE_DIALOG_GAME_OVER=You really need to be able to decrypt this message before the computer. Let's start from scratch!
ARCADE_DIALOG_TOO_MANY_BLOCKS_TITLE=Game over (player does not play properly)
ARCADE_DIALOG_TOO_MANY_BLOCKS=To decrypt the message you have to cancel out the blocks, you are accumulating them.
ARCADE_DIALOG_ANNOUNCE_PUBLICKEY=You will create your private key / public key pair but <span> ... </ span> do not forget, this private key is ... private! You alone must know it! Your public key will be disseminated on the network to all the researchers of the Institute.
ARCADE_DIALOG_ANNOUNCE_PUBLICKEY_TITLE=Dialogue 'You will create your key pair' (Researcher)
ARCADE_DIALOG_HERE_PRIVATEKEY=Here is your private key, use the keys LEFT and RIGHT to manipulate it according to your desire. Press UP or SPACE to invert your key and when you are ready, press DOWN to confirm your choice.
ARCADE_DIALOG_HERE_PRIVATEKEY_TITLE=Dialogue 'Here is your private key' (Researcher)
ARCADE_DIALOG_CREATE_PUBLICKEY=To generate your public key, drop your private key six or seven times. If the security level is sufficient, your public key will be saved, otherwise the computer will complete it.
ARCADE_DIALOG_SUCCESS=Congratulations, you understood how it works!
